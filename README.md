Personal Website / Portfolio

# Purpose
Will be used in the coming weeks as the main repository for my personal website to display my portfolio, which includes more than just the projects here on Github.
The projects include a number of things, such as:
- Websites built on frameworks in different languages such as Laravel, NuxtJS, and NextJS.
- Discord bots written in Python and NodeJS.
